            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                     <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                     <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                     <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>                    
                     <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
                     <li>¾ teaspoon salt </li>
                     <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
                     <li>½ cup milk </li>
                     <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
                     <li>3 eggs</li>
             </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!</li>
                <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
                <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            </ol>
